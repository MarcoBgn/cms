If you're living at home with other family members you may not be directly responsible for paying bills, rent or mortgage.

However, you may be asked to make a contribution towards them.

Whatever the arrangement you have with your family, it's a good idea to sit down with them and work out a budget.

This will help you get into the habit of managing your money to make sure it lasts all month.

Sit down together and make a plan that you can all stick to.

Setting up a budget means you’re:
* less likely to end up in debt
* less likely to get caught out by unexpected costs
* more likely to have a good credit rating
* more likely to be accepted for a loan or mortgage
* able to see where you can make savings
* in a great position to save up for something you'd like

#### What you need
To get started on your budget, you’ll need to work out how much you spend on:
* bills
* living costs
* family and friends (presents…)
* travel (car costs, public transport…)
* leisure (trips out, sport, restaurants, pubs…)

You can use our ['My Money' tool](/my-money) to save your information and come back to it anytime you like to make changes if your circumstances change.

Or you can set up a budget using a spreadsheet or just write it all down on a piece of paper.

Keep a spending diary and keep a note of everything you buy in a month.

Or, if you do most of your spending with a bank card, have a look at last month’s bank statement and work out where your money is going.

If you’re spending more than you have coming in, work out where you can cut back.

Use our [Quick cash finder](https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/tools/quick-cash-finder) to see how small changes can save big money.

#### Paying off loans and credit cards
If you have loans or owe money on credit cards it usually makes sense to pay off the debt that charges the highest rate of interest first.

Examples include:
* store cards, which normally charge the highest rates of interest
* credit cards
* personal loans from the bank, which normally charge a lower rate of interest than credit or store cards

It is important to make sure you don’t break the terms of any of your agreements

So even if you’re focusing on paying down one debt, you must pay:
* at least the minimum on any credit cards
* your agreed payments on any loan

Use our ['Money Health Check' tool](https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/tools/health-check) to get a clear picture of your finances and get personalised advice on how to improve your situation.

If you’ve already missed payments, get advice from a free debt adviser straight away.

They can help you, no matter how big or small your debt.

#### Set a savings goal
Although money may be tight, see if you can set a goal of saving some extra money to draw on while you’re on Universal Credit.

The best way to save money is to pay something into a savings account every month.
