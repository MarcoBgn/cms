If you find you're not managing with money, you might think about borrowing to cope until you get back on your feet.

Try to stay away from high-cost borrowing like:
* doorstep lenders
* payday loans
* logbook loans

Before looking at other ways to borrow, make sure you understand:
* exactly how much it will cost you
* whether you can afford the repayments

#### Borrowing from family and friends
Borrowing money from a family member or a friend can help you avoid the risks that go with high-cost borrowing, like payday loans or log book loans.

Friends or family may be more flexible about when you pay the money back. However, be careful what you promise.

Make sure that both you and the person you’re borrowing from take the time to:
* work out an affordable repayment plan
* discuss what will happen if you’re late paying it back or don’t repay it at all
* put your agreement in writing if you need to.

#### Budgeting Advances
If you need money for an essential expense, talk to your work coach about applying for a Budgeting Advance.

Things you can apply for include:
* furniture
* baby items, such as a cot or pram
* household appliances (eg: cookers or fridges)
* clothing or footwear
* work clothes or tools
* travelling expenses
* childcare costs to cover training courses

To get a Budgeting Advance:
* you or your partner, husband or wife must have been getting Universal Credit, income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance, income-related Employment Support Allowance or State Pension Credit for a continuous period of at least six months
* you must have earned less than £2,600 if you’re single (£3,600 if you’re in a couple) in the past six months
* you must not be paying off another Budgeting Advance

##### If you've been on Universal Credit less than six months
You can ask for a Budgeting Advance to help with getting back into work or staying in work, for example to pay for upfront childcare costs.

##### Changes of circumstances
You can also ask for a Budgeting Advance if you have a change of circumstances that would increase your next Universal Credit payment and you won't be able to manage for money until it arrives.

This might be something like a new baby.

You will usually have to start paying back your Budgeting Advance out of your next Universal Credit payment and pay it back within six months.

Ask your work coach about how to claim a Budgeting Advance.

#### Borrowing from a credit union
Loans from credit unions are much cheaper than other high cost borrowing.

You can pay the money back at a rate you can afford

There’s a cap on the amount of interest they can charge and many credit unions will charge less than this.

There are no hidden charges or penalties if you repay the loan early.

#### Overdrafts
Your current account may offer an interest-free overdraft up to an agreed limit.

Some current accounts will offer an automatic agreed limit but you may have to pay fees and charges.

If you do go into overdraft make sure you know what your agreed limit is.

If you go over this, you may be charged extra fees as well as interest charges.

These charges can be very expensive.

Talk to your bank about your circumstances so they understand why you are overdrawn.

#### Home credit or doorstep lending
Home credit or doorstep lending can be very expensive compared to other types of borrowing.

You might pay back much more in interest compared to other ways of borrowing, like a loan from a credit union.

#### Before you take out home credit
Make sure you shop around and compare the total cost of the loan  with other lenders before you sign up to an agreement.

You can compare the cost of home credit compared to other borrowing on the [Lenders Compared website.](http://www.lenderscompared.org.uk/)
