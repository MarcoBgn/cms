Getting behind on your rent can be stressful and overwhelming.

Most landlords want to help you stay in your home and help you to work out the best way to get back on track.

Talk to your landlord and tell them you are having problems.

If you can pay back the arrears, agree a plan for doing this.

If you'll struggle to pay, talk to a free debt adviser. You don't have to deal with this on your own.

There are lots of ways to deal with debt, even if you think you have no spare money to pay back what you owe.

A free debt adviser can help you work out the best solution for you.

#### Did you know?
Eight out of ten people say they feel less stressed and anxious and more in control of their situation after taking debt advice.

#### Paying your rent using Direct Payments
If you have missed two rent payments either you or your landlord can ask for a Direct Payment as part of an Alternative Payment Arrangement.

A Direct Payment means your rent will be paid directly to your landlord until you get back on track.

This will stop you getting further behind on your rent while you sort out your arrears.

#### Paying off rent arrears using Direct Deductions
Your landlord can ask for your rent arrears to be paid back through Direct Deductions.

An amount will be taken each month out of your Universal Credit payment to pay back what you owe.

If the Direct Deduction payment is too high, you may not have enough money to live on and you may get deeper into debt.

You can ask to make lower repayments.

Talk to your work coach or the Universal Credit service centre to arrange this.

It's really important you are honest about:
* other debts you have
* how much money you've got coming in

This is so that they can help you set the repayments at a rate you can afford.

#### Can you be evicted for rent arrears?
Landlords don't want to see you lose your home.

But if you don't work with them to pay back what you owe, they can apply to the court to start eviction proceedings.

If you're renting privately, it's likely you have an assured shorthold tenancy agreement.

This makes it easier for a landlord to evict you than if you have another type of tenancy agreement, especially if you have rent arrears.

There are legal processes your landlord must follow to evict you. If they don't, there is action you can take.

Check your tenancy agreement to find out what contract you have.

#### Do you still have to pay back rent arrears if you're evicted?
Your landlord can apply to the court for a money judgment at the same time as they apply for a notice to evict you.

This orders you to pay back your rent arears even if you're evicted.

#### Getting help
If you receive a Section 21 notice or a notice seeking possession from the court, get urgent help.

They are court notices that start the eviction process.
