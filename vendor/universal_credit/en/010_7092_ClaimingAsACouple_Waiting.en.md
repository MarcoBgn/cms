    task01: Talk to my partner about how I manage my Universal Credit payment
---
As a couple where both partners are eligible for Universal Credit, you’ll get one payment for both of you.
You can choose to have it paid into a joint or a single account.

#### When a joint account is a good idea

* You both have similar spending patterns and habits
* You can agree on a budget or spending plan
* You can talk about money with your partner without arguing
* You can agree ground rules for spending, for instance when it’s OK to go ahead and buy something and when you have to discuss it with your partner

Read our guide for more about joint accounts and [how to set one up.](https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/joint-accounts)

#### When a joint account is not a good idea

* If one of you has a problem with over-spending or mis-spending
* If your partner has a poor credit history

Having a joint bank account with someone who has a poor credit history may affect your credit rating as well as your partner's.

Just living with someone, or being married to them, will not affect your credit score if you have an account in your own name.

If you are concerned that your partner’s bad credit rating might affect your own, you can ask for the payment to be paid into your own account.
