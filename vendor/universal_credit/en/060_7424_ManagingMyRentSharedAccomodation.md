If you're living in shared accommodation, check the terms of your tenancy agreement to find out if:
* you signed as a group
* you all have your own tenancy agreements

#### If you signed as a group

If you signed as a group and you can't afford to pay your share, the people you live with are liable to pay it.

If possible, talk to the people you live with to see if they can cover your share until you get paid.

If this isn't possible, talk to your landlord and try to reach an agreement so that your housemates won't be asked to pay.

#### If you signed your own tenancy agreement
You are liable for paying your share of the rent. Neither you nor your landlord can ask your housemates to cover your share.

Talk to your landlord and try to reach an agreement about how you can manage your rent until you get paid.

#### If you will struggle to pay your rent
If you're in financial need, have no other means of support and you won't be able to manage until your first UC payment, you can ask for a Universal Credit Advance.

* you can get up to half of the Universal Credit payment you are likely to get as an Advance
* the money is usually paid to you within 72 hours
* you must usually pay back the Advance within six months
* the first repayment will be taken out of your first UC payment

Talk to your work coach about how to apply for a Universal Credit Advance.
