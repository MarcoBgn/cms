    task01: Talk to my lender about how I will cover my mortgage payments until my first Universal Credit payment
---
If you are working and claiming Universal Credit, you can't claim any help with housing costs.

You should already be claiming the maximum work allowance of £397 a month if you have:
* dependent children, or
* an illness or disability that affects you working

This can help with your mortgage costs.

If you don't have children and are fit to work you don't get the work allowance.

There are things that you can do to cope in the short term.

#### Check if you have insurance cover
You might have:
* Mortgage Payment Protection Insurance (MPPI)
* Accident, Sickness and Unemployment (ASU) insurance

This can help with your mortgage repayments if your income has fallen because of redundancy, accident or sickness.

You may have taken it out when you got your mortgage and forgotten about it.

Look through your mortgage paperwork or check with your lender or mortgage broker.

MPPI or ASU insurance can be offered as an add-on to other insurance policies or banking services.

Make sure you look at this paperwork too.

If you have it, make your claim as soon as you can.

#### Keeping up with repayments
If you're starting to struggle with your mortgage repayments, talk to your lender straight away.

Your lender should be keen to help and will talk through your options to keep up with your repayments.

They must try to reach an agreement with you.

You could try:
* changing the way you make payments, for example, just paying off the interest for a while
* changing when you make payments, for example, taking a payment holiday
* extending the term of your mortgage - you'll pay back a lower amount each month over a longer period of time.
