    task01: Set up a Direct Debit or standing order for my rent to be paid on the right day
---
Set up a Direct Debit or standing order for your rent to come out of your bank account the day after you get:
* your Universal Credit payment, or
* your wages if you're working

If you have other income coming in, you can decide which date works best for you.

You could also think about keeping your rent money in a separate bank account.

That way, you can be sure your rent is taken care of and you'll know exactly how much you've got left to spend for the rest of the month.

#### If your housing cost element doesnâ€™t cover all your rent

You might be able to claim a Discretionary Housing Payment (DHP) to cover the shortfall in your rent from your local council.

They can also cover other eligible housing costs, like some service charges or tenancy deposits.

The council decides how long you will get a DHP for.

You may have to reapply when the payment ends.

You may get enough to cover all your rent or just part of it.

Payments can be weekly, fortnightly, monthly or a lump sum.

You do not have to repay a DHP.

The council must be fair and reasonable when deciding your case.

Contact your [local council and ask for a Discretionary Housing Payment.](https://www.gov.uk/find-your-local-council)

#### If you start to struggle with rent payments

Talk to your work coach about setting up a More Frequent Payment (MFP) as part of an Alternative Payment Arrangment.

This means your Universal Credit will be paid to you twice or four times a month to make sure your rent is paid, until you manage to sort things out.

Your work coach may refer you for personal budgeting support to help you manage your money.

Contact your work coach to ask about a More Frequent Payment.

If you are struggling to pay other bills as well as your rent, get help urgently.
