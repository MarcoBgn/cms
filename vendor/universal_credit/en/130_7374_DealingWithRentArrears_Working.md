Getting behind on your rent can be stressful and overwhelming.

Most landlords want to help you stay in your home and help you to work out the best way to get back on track.

Talk to your tenancy support officer or housing officer now.

Your income officer can also put you in touch with people who can help you.

Lots of social housing landlords have teams that are there just to help people who are struggling to pay their rent.

They can help you come up with a plan for what to do.

It's really important you are honest about:
* other debts you have
* how much money you've got coming in

This is because your repayments need to be set at an amount you can afford.

#### Paying your rent using Direct Payments
If you have missed two rent payments either you or your landlord can ask for a Direct Payment as part of an Alternative Payment Arrangement.

A Direct Payment means your rent will be paid directly to your landlord until you get back on track.

This will stop you getting further behind on your rent while you sort out your arrears.

#### Paying off rent arrears using Direct Deductions
Your landlord can ask for your rent arrears to be paid back through Direct Deductions.

An amount will be taken each month out of your Universal Credit payment to pay back what you owe.

If the Direct Deduction payment is too high, you may not have enough money to live on and you may get deeper into debt.

If this is the case, you can ask to make lower repayments.

Talk to your work coach or the Universal Credit service centre to arrange this.

It's very important you tell them if you are paying off other debts as well as your rent arrears.

This is so that they can help you set the repayments at a rate you can afford.

#### Can you lose your home?
Landlords don't want to see you lose your home.

But if you don't tell your landlord you're struggling and work with them to sort it out, they will start trying to recover the money.

As a last resort, they could take court action and you could lose your home.

#### Don't struggle alone
You don't have to deal with this on your own.

There are lots of ways to deal with debts even if you think you have no spare money to pay back what you owe.

A free debt adviser can help you find a solution that's best for you.
