When you're on Universal Credit, you have to pay rent directly to your landlord.

You'll need to keep rent separate from other spending money.

Direct debits and standing orders are a good way to pay your rent without you having to think about it each month.

Or you can think about keeping your rent money in a separate bank account.

If you pay your rent just after your payment comes in, you'll know exactly how much you've got left to spend for the rest of the month.

Find out more about setting up [separate bank accounts to pay your rent and bills](/en/articles/setting-up-multiple-bank-accounts).

Here's what to do while you're waiting for your first payment:
* find out how to set up a Direct Debit or standing order to pay your rent on the same day each month
* contact your landlord to see if it's possible to change your rent date
* check with your work coach how much the housing cost element of your UC payment will be. It may not cover the full cost of your rent. If it doesn't, think about how you will make up the shortfall
* If you're eligible, think about switching to a fee-free basic bank account so you don't have to pay bank charges

#### Top tip

Wait until your first Universal Credit payment has come in before you set up a Direct Debit or standing order to pay your rent. You will then know what date your money will come in each month.

#### If you don't have enough money to pay your rent until your first payment

* talk to your landlord, tenancy support officer or income officer straight away to let them know and agree what you can do
* offer to pay what you can until you get paid
* ask your work coach for a Universal Credit Advance until you get paid. You have to pay this back
