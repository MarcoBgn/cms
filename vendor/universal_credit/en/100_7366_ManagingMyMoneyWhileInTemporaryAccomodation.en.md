If you're living in temporary accommodation, such as a hostel, bed and breakfast or refuge, you may have your rent paid for you if you need care, support or supervision.

If you don't need support and are managing your own finances, you will be responsible for paying your own rent.

If you are worried about paying your rent, talk to your work coach, landord or accommodation manager to work out what you can do.

#### Fee-free basic bank accounts
A fee-free basic bank account could be right for you if don't have a permanent address at the moment.

With a fee-free basic bank account, you can make regular bill payments.

You won’t be able to get an overdraft, but your bank won’t charge you fees for missed payments.

You usually need photo ID, like a passport or driving licence, to open a bank account.

If you haven't got this ID, your bank or building society may accept other documents as proof of identity or address.

Ask your work coach to give you a letter confirming your right to get Universal Credit.

You can also ask for a letter confirming who you are from these people:
* your workplace or college
* warden or manager where you are living
* minister of religion
* your GP

The letter must be an original copy. Photocopies won't do.

#### Work out a budget
It's a good idea to sit down and work out a budget.

This will help you get into the habit of managing your money to make sure it lasts all month.

Make a plan that you can stick to.

Setting up a budget means you’re:
* less likely to end up in debt
* less likely to get caught out by unexpected costs
* more likely to have a good credit rating
* more likely to be accepted for a loan or mortgage
* able to see where you can make savings
* in a great position to save if you can

#### What you need to work out a budget
To get started on your budget, you’ll need to work out how much you spend on:
* bills
* living costs
* family and friends (presents, parties…)
* travel (car costs, public transport…)
* leisure (trips out, sport, restaurants, pubs…)

You can use our Money Manager [***add link***] to save your information and then come back to it anytime you like if your circumstances change.

Or you can set up a budget using a spreadsheet or just write it all down on a piece of paper.

Keep a spending diary and keep a note of everything you buy in a month.

If you’re spending more than you have coming in, work out where you can cut back.
