#### If your partner is mis-spending money

Mis-spending might be on things like drugs, alcohol or gambling due to addiction.

There might be other reasons that make your partner overspend, such as mental health issues.

If your partner is mis-spending money that should be used to pay for essential bills, like rent or food, talk to your work coach about setting up a Split Payment as part of an Alternative Payment Arrangment (APA).

#### If you're worried about financial abuse

If you’re worried about your partner taking control of your monthly payment and leaving you without any cash of your own, it’s important to know that this is financial abuse.

Tell your work coach if you think your partner may take control of your monthly payment.

Your work coach can arrange a Split Payment as part of an Alternative Payment Arrangement.

You can ask for a Split Payment to be set up at any point during your Universal Credit claim.

If you're worried for your safety because of reporting financial abuse, there is support and help for you and your family.
