#### Extra help if you have children

#### Help with your childcare costs

While you're getting Universal Credit, you can get help with eligible childcare costs, no matter how many hours you work.

If you have a partner, you must both be working to get extra help with these costs.

Your childcare must be provided by a registered child carer.

To make a claim you will need to provide evidence of your childcare place and the actual cost of childcare with invoices or receipts.

#### How much can you claim?

You will be able to claim back up to 85 per cent of the amount you pay out for childcare costs.
This payment is capped so you could receive a maximum monthly childcare payment of up to:

* £646 for one child
* £1,108 for two or more children

#### If you get a job

Childcare support is paid in arrears, so if you think you need help with up-front costs, you should discuss this with your work coach or Universal Credit helpline as soon as possible if you receive a firm job offer.

You might get help with fees or deposits for your childcare place before the job starts.

You can also talk to your work coach about your job offer and other support available to you. This could help you get a routine in place for when you start work.

#### If your job ends

You can claim childcare costs for at least a month after your employment ends.

If you are moving between jobs this can help you to keep your childcare place until you take up your new role.

#### If you have another child

You can carry on getting support for childcare costs if you are claiming Universal Credit and getting:
* Statutory Sick Pay
* Statutory Maternity Pay
* Ordinary Statutory Paternity Pay
* Additional Statutory Paternity Pay
* Shared Parental Pay
* Statutory Adoption Pay
* Maternity Allowance

This is so you don't lose your childcare place while you're on maternity or paternity leave and makes it easier for you to return to work when you're ready.

#### Free school meals

While you're getting Universal Credit your child may be able to get free school meals.

You need to apply to your local council.

Apply for free school meals on the [GOV.UK website.](https://www.gov.uk/apply-free-school-meals)

#### Help with school costs

While you're getting Universal Credit you might be able to get help with the costs of:

* school clothing
* activities, such as music lessons and sports coaching
* travel to school on public transport
