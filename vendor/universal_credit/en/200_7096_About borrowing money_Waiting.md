    task01: Try to find low-cost ways of borrowing money
---
If you find you're not managing for money, you might think about borrowing to cope until you get back on your feet.

Try to stay away from high-cost borrowing like:
* doorstep lenders
* payday loans
* logbook loans

Before looking at other ways to borrow, make sure you understand:
* exactly how much it will cost you
* whether you can afford the repayments

#### Borrowing from family and friends
Borrowing emergency money from a family member or a friend can help you avoid the risks that go with high cost borrowing, like payday loans or log book loans.

Make sure that both you and the person you're borrowing from take the time to:
* work out a repayment plan
* discuss what will happen if you're late paying it back or don't repay it at all
* put your agreement in writing if you need to

#### Overdrafts
Your current account may offer an interest-free overdraft up to an agreed limit.

Some current accounts will offer an automatic agreed limit but you may have to pay fees and charges.

If you do go into overdraft make sure you know what your agreed limit is.

If you go over this, you may be charged extra fees as well as interest charges.

These fees can be very expensive.

Talk to your bank about when you expect to get your first UC payment so they understand why you are overdrawn.

#### Borrowing from a credit union
Loans from credit unions are much cheaper than other high-cost borrowing.

There's a cap on the amount of interest they can charge. Many charge less than this.

There are no hidden charges or penalties if you repay the loan early.

Find out if there is a credit union in your area.

#### Home credit and doorstep loans
Home credit or doorstep lending can be very expensive compared to other types of borrowing.

Before you decide to take out one of these loans, compare the cost with other ways to borrow.

You might pay back much more compared to other ways of borrowing, like a loan from a credit union.

Shop around and compare the cost with other lenders before you sign up to an agreement.

You can compare the cost of using home credit on the [Lenders compared website.](http://www.lenderscompared.org.uk/)

#### If you're struggling with debt or everyday bills
Borrowing money to pay off debts or arrears is a sign you are heading into problem debt.
