If you’ve missed mortgage payments, speak to your lender as soon as possible.

They will be able to discuss options to help you avoid losing your home.

A debt adviser can also help you talk to your mortgage lender. If you have other debts, they will help you sort out which ones to pay first.

#### Dealing with mortgage arrears in the short term
To deal with arrears in the short term, you could discuss with your lender:
* changing the way you make payments, for example, just paying off the interest for a while
* changing when you make payments, for example taking a payment holiday
* extending the term of your mortgage - you'll pay back a lower amount each month over a longer period of time.

#### What your lender must do
Your lender must talk through the options to keep up with your repayments.

They must also follow a set of rules called a pre-action protocol to help you keep your home.

Your lender must:
* tell you how exactly much you owe and any interest charges you’ll have to pay
* consider a request from you to change the way you pay your mortgage
* respond to any offer of payment you make
* if they turn down your offer of payment, they must explain their reasons within ten working days, and
* give you 15 working days’ written warning if they plan to start court action because you haven’t kept to a repayment agreement

If your case goes to court, both you and your lender have to prove to the judge that you have followed these conditions.

Your lender must not seek repossession unless all other reasonable attempts to find a solution have failed.

#### Dealing with mortgage arrears in the long term
If it looks unlikely your situation will improve, you may have to think about other options.

#### Selling your home as a last resort
You can clear arrears by selling your home and renting or moving to a cheaper property if you have enough equity in it to do this.

Ask your lender if it offers help through an Assisted Voluntary Sale scheme.

Assisted Voluntary Sale schemes can:
* give you time to sell the property
* provide help with the costs of selling it
* allow you to make lower mortgage repayments until you’ve managed to sell your home.

If your lender doesn't offer an Assisted Voluntary Sale scheme, make sure you keep them up to date with what's happening.

If you do everything you can to sell your home, they should give you reasonable time to move.

Depending on your property, check whether you can sell your home to your council or a social landlord and stay there as tenant.

#### Things to avoid
Some solutions to mortgage arrears can seem like a good idea but they may lead to more problems.

#### Taking out an additional loan to pay your debts
These loans can be very expensive and are often secured on your home, so putting it at greater risk.

Mortgage offers that promise to help you avoid repossession may also put your home at greater risk.

#### Handing back the keys
You’ll still be responsible for the mortgage repayments before your home is sold.

You may also be responsible for paying the outstanding balance if the money raised by selling your home isn’t enough to pay off what you owe.

#### Selling your home without having a place to live
Your local council may not help you find a place to live if they think you’ve made yourself intentionally homeless.

#### Sale-and-rent-back schemes
This is where you sell your home to a company and rent it back from them.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has stopped several of these schemes from operating because they treated customers unfairly.

#### Get free debt advice
Talk to a free debt adviser before you consider any of these options.

There are many ways to deal with debts, including some you may not know about.

An adviser can help you work out the best solution for you, even if you think you have no money to pay back what you owe.
