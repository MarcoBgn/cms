#### Warm Home Discount

A Warm Home Discount can give you £140 off your electricity bill.

If you're on a low income, and getting certain means-tested benefits, including Universal Credit, you may be able to get it.

Talk to your electricity supplier to see if they can offer it to you.

If you don't qualify for a Warm Home Discount with your supplier, see if you can switch to one where you do.

Read more about the Warm Home Discount and who offers it on the [GOV.UK website.](https://www.gov.uk/the-warm-home-discount-scheme/what-youll-get)

#### Switch energy suppliers
If you pay your energy bills directly, you could save up to £200 a year by switching gas and electricity suppliers.

It only takes 20 minutes to check.

#### If your landlord pays the energy supplier
If your landlord pays your energy supplier directly and asks for the money from you, they have to switch suppliers.

You can ask your landlord to check if it's the best deal and switch to a cheaper supplier.

There are limits to how much your landlord can charge you if you pay them directly for energy.

If you're worried that your landlord might be overcharging you, read this guide ['What your landlord can charge you for energy' on the Citizens Advice website.](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/energy/energy-supply/problems-with-your-energy-supply/what-your-landlord-can-charge-for-energy/)

#### If you're on a pre-payment meter
It may be possible to switch suppliers to a better deal if you're the account holder.

Find out more about switching suppliers if you're on a pre-payment meter on the [Moneysaving expert website.](http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/utilities/switch-prepaid-gas-electricity)

#### Local help to pay energy bills
If you're going without gas or electricity, your local welfare scheme may help with top-up vouchers.

Each country in the UK runs its own scheme.
* If you live in England, [contact your local council.](https://www.gov.uk/find-your-local-council).
* If you live in Scotland, [apply to the Scottish Welfare Fund on the Scottish Government website.](http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/People/welfarereform/scottishwelfarefund).
* If you live in Wales, [apply to the Discretionary Assistance Fund.](http://www.moneymadeclearwales.org/home.php?page_id=60).

#### Water bills
Depending on your circumstances, you might be able to save money on your water bills if you ask for a meter to be installed.

For information about this and other tips, read our guide ['Save money on your water bill'.](/en/articles/save-money-on-your-water-bill)

#### Energy saving improvements
You might be able to get help with the costs of making your home more energy efficient if you're getting certain benefits, including Universal Credit.

Improvements include:
* insulating your home
* replacing your boiler

#### Car and home insurance
You might be charged more for your car or home insurance if you're not working.

Car insurance is essential if you need to drive to look for work. It's also illegal not to have it.

Find out how to get cheaper insurance when you're unemployed on the [Money Supermarket website](https://www.moneysupermarket.com/car-insurance/unemployed/)

Always look around for cheaper quotes from other insurers. Go back to your existing insurer to see if they will match it to keep you as a customer.

If you go for a cheaper quote with another insurer, make sure you are getting the right cover for your needs.

If you can afford it, paying your premium once a year is usually cheaper than paying monthly.
