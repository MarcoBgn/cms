If you're starting to struggle with your mortgage repayments, talk to your lender straight away.

There are things you can do to cope in the short term.

#### Check if you have insurance cover
You might have:
* Mortgage Payment Protection Insurance (MPPI)
* Accident, Sickness and Unemployment (ASU) insurance

This can help with your mortgage repayments if your income has fallen because of redundancy, accident or sickness.

You may have taken it out when you got your mortgage and forgotten about it.

Look through your mortgage paperwork or check with your lender or mortgage broker.

MPPI or ASU insurance can be offered as an add-on to other insurance policies or banking services. Make sure you look at this paperwork too.

If you have it, make your claim as soon as you can.

#### Keeping up with repayments
Your lender must try to help you and should talk through your options to keep up with your repayments.

They must try to reach an agreement with you.

You could try:
* changing the way you make payments, for example, just paying off the interest for a while
* changing when you make payments, for example taking a payment holiday
* extending the term of your mortgage, so that you'll pay back a lower amount each month over a longer period of time

#### Claim Support for Mortgage Interest (SMI)

If you're not working and claiming Universal Credit, you might be able to get government help with your mortgage interest payments.

This is called Support for Mortgage Interest (SMI).

You will only get SMI after nine months if you have no earned income while you were waiting, like pay from:
* part-time or full-time work
* any benefits from your employer, like Statutory Sick Pay or Statutory Maternity Pay

#### How Support for Mortgage Interest works

You have to have been receiving Universal Credit for nine assessment periods (around nine months) continuously before you can get it but you can make a claim now.

The payments are usually made direct to your mortgage lender.

The payments do not pay off the outstanding capital on your mortgage. The capital is the amount of money you originally borrowed.

The payments are based on a standard rate of interest applied to the amount you have outstanding on your mortgage and any other loans secured on your property - up to a maximum of £200,000.

The standard rate of interest might be less than the interest rate you're paying on your mortgage.

If it is, you will have to pay the rest yourself.

The payments will stop as soon as you start work again, even if you’re only earning a small amount.

Ask your work coach what the current interest rate for SMI is and check with your mortgage lender whether this will cover all your interest payments.

If it doesn't, talk to your lender about what you can do.

#### If you get paid work
If you get any paid work while you're waiting for SMI to start, your waiting period will stop.

You will have to claim SMI again when your paid work ends. This will mean waiting another nine months without earned income before SMI will be paid.
