Your Universal Credit payment is paid into your bank account.

It needs to be one where you can make and receive payments using Direct Debits or standing orders.

#### Fee-free basic bank accounts
With a fee-free basic bank account, you can set up Direct Debits or standing orders to make regular payments, such as your rent or bills.

You won’t be able to get an overdraft but your bank won’t charge you fees for missed payments.

A fee-free basic bank account could be right for you if:
* you haven’t had a bank account before
* you have a poor credit history
* you have money problems at the moment
* find it hard to prove your ID
* don't have a permanent address

#### If you're worried about proving your ID
You usually need photo ID, like a passport or driving licence to open a bank account.

If you don’t, your bank or building society may accept other documents as proof of identity or address.

Ask your work coach to give you a letter confirming your right to get Universal Credit.

You can also ask for a letter confirming who you are from these people:
* your workplace or college
* social landlord
* care home manager
* warden of sheltered accommodation, hostel or refuge
* armed services officer
* minister of religion
* your GP

The letter must be an original copy. Photocopies won't do.

#### Using more than one account to manage your rent and bills
Some people find it easier to open more than one bank account to keep their money separate for different types of spending.
