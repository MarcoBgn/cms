    task01: Look at my budget to see if I can make savings
---
Universal Credit can offer more opportunities for working or increasing your hours, but if you're a carer for someone, you may not be able to do as much work as you would like because of your caring responsibilities.

However there may be other ways you can increase income while you're on Universal Credit.

#### Look at your budget
It's a good idea to sit down and look again at your budget to see if you can cut back on anything.

Work out how much you spend on:
* bills
* costs
* family and friends (presents…)
* travel (car costs, public transport…)
* leisure (trips out, sport, restaurants, pubs…)

You can use our ['My Money' tool](/my-money) to save your information and come back to it anytime you like to make changes if your circumstances change.

You can also set up a budget using a spreadsheet or just write it all down on a piece of paper.

Keep a spending diary and keep a note of everything you buy in a month.

Use our [Quick cash finder](https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/tools/quick-cash-finder) to help you see where you could save money.

####  Grants and charities
There are lots of grants and charities that offer help to people caring for someone who is ill or disabled.

Use the [Turn2Us grants search](https://grants-search.turn2us.org.uk/) for yourself and the person you care for to see if you might be entitled to help.

#### Get a carer's assessment
If you haven't already had a carer's assessment, it's your right to have one, so get in touch with your local authority to arrange one as soon as you can.

The assessment will look at the support you might need to be able to carry on giving the care you do.

You may be entitled to a range of support services, many of which are provided free through social services.

You may also be entitled to financial support to help pay for the things that will make your caring role easier.

Help includes:
* Time out: Short breaks from your caring role, including respite care, can give you a chance to recharge your batteries.
* Practical help: Things that perhaps used to be simple, such as housework, laundry, grocery shopping or gardening, which can become a strain when you’re caring for someone.
* Modifications: Equipment or alterations to the home that can make life easier.
* Emotional support: Whether it’s professional counselling or just someone to talk to on a regular basis.
* Support to improve your well-being: Access to exercise, learning opportunities or social activities.
* Advocacy: Having someone to speak on your behalf.
