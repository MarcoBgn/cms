It can take up to six weeks to get your first Universal Credit payment.

If you have very little or no money coming in, and can't manage until you get your first payment, here's what you can do:

Ask your work coach about a Universal Credit Advance until your first benefit payment arrives.

* you may be able to get up to half of the Universal Credit payment you are likely to get as an Advance
* you must be entitled to get Universal Credit
* be in financial need
* able to repay the advance back over the next six months
* the money is usually paid into your bank account within 72 hours
* the first repayment will be taken out of your first Universal Credit payment

#### Help if you have an emergency expense
There may be some help available if you need to find money quickly for an emergency or unexpected expense.

#### Local welfare schemes
If you are facing a sudden emergency and are on a very low income, you can apply to your local welfare scheme for vouchers to pay for essentials such as:
* food
* clothing
* fuel
* household items, such as cookers or fridges

These schemes have replaced help that used to be available from the Social Fund.

Each country in the UK now runs its own scheme.

If you live in England, [contact your local council](https://www.gov.uk/find-your-local-council)

If you live in Scotland, apply to the [Scottish Welfare Fund on the Scottish Government website](http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/People/welfarereform/scottishwelfarefund).

If you live in Wales, [apply to the Discretionary Assistance Fund](http://www.moneymadeclearwales.org/home.php?page_id=60).

#### Other local support
If youâ€™re struggling to eat, your local food bank may be able to give you a few days supply of food.

Food banks can also give you vouchers for gas and electricity if you're on a pre-pay meter and you've no money to top up.

You usually can't go straight to a food bank.

You need to speak to someone who can refer you first.

People who can refer you include:
* your GP
* support worker
* a local charity, like Citizens Advice
* the police

Your local [Trussell Trust foodbank](https://www.trusselltrust.org/get-help/find-a-foodbank/) can tell you who else to speak to in your area to get a referral.

#### Other grants and help
If you're on a very low income, local charities and organisations may be able to offer financial help.

Search for what's available in your area on the [Turn2Us website.](https://www.turn2us.org.uk/Find-Benefits-Grants)
