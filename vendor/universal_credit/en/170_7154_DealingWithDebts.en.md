#### If you're falling behind with gas and electricity bills
Contact your supplier and explain that you’re struggling to pay your bills.

Your supplier should treat you fairly and allow you to repay at a rate you can afford.

If you're not working, you or your supplier can ask to pay the money back out of your Universal Credit payment through Direct Deductions.

If you do this, make sure it is at a rate you can afford.

#### Switching to a cheaper supplier when you're in arrears
If you pay your energy bills directly and have been in arrears for less than 28 days, you might be able to switch suppliers to a cheaper rate and take your debt with you.

If you’ve owed the money for more than 28 days you can switch to a cheaper supplier but your debt must be below:

* £500 for gas
* £500 for electricity

#### If you're struggling to pay off a payday loan
Contact your lender as soon as possible and let them know your situation.

If you’re struggling with repayments on a payday loan, the lender has to give you reasonable time to get free debt advice and repay the debt.

This may include freezing interest and charges or agreeing a repayment plan with you.

Don’t roll your loan over or put all your debts into a new loan unless you know what the lender will charge you for this and you know you can repay the loan on time.

If you don’t repay on time, your debts can quickly spiral out of control.

Some credit unions may help you pay off a payday loan more quickly.

They will repay the loan for you. You then pay the credit union back at a rate you can afford. You need to be a member first.

#### If you're in arrears with Council Tax

Council Tax is a priority bill so make sure that you keep up to date with payments if you are paying towards your Council Tax.

Falling behind can have more serious consequences.

Many councils have a hardship fund which you can apply to for help with paying your bill.

Talk to your local council now about how to pay back arrears.

[Find your local council.](https://www.gov.uk/find-your-local-council)

A free debt adviser can help you talk to the council if you're not sure what to say.

They won't judge you or make you feel bad about your situation.

And they can help you find ways to deal with your debts even if you think you have no spare money.

#### If you're getting behind on credit debts
Before you pay off credit debts, think first about how you can pay priority debts like:
* rent
* mortgage
* gas or electricity bills
* Council Tax

If you're paying off credit debts, making only the minimum payment could mean your debt spirals out of control very quickly.

If you miss payments, they are recorded on your credit file. This can make it harder to get credit in the future.

If your landlord or energy provider asks if you can make payments out of your Universal Credit payment through a Direct Deduction, make sure they are at a rate you can afford.

If repayments are set too high, you won't have enough money to live on and risk getting further into debt.

Be honest about all the debts you have.

Now might be the time to talk to a free debt adviser about what to do.

A debt adviser will:
* never judge you or make you feel bad about your situation
* always be happy to talk to you, however big or small your problem
* find ways to help you manage your debts even if you think you have no spare money
* suggest ways to deal with debts that you might not know about
