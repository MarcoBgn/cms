#### Using separate bank accounts for different types of spending
Some people prefer to set up separate bank accounts to cover different types of monthly spending.

To help you work out how many accounts to open, group your spending into just a few main areas – for example:

* rent or mortgage
* bills
* car
* savings

Once you’ve opened a separate account for each area of spending, you need to tell your bank to:
* set up standing orders that automatically transfer money from your main account into the other accounts just after your Universal Credit or wages come in
* set up a Direct Debit for each of your bills

Find out how to set up [Direct Debits and standing orders.](/en/articles/direct-debits-and-standing-orders)

#### Pros
* You can spend from your main account knowing your important bills are paid
* You can spread the cost of bills you might have to pay every few months, like electricity or gas

#### Cons
* You’ll need to manage all your accounts carefully to make sure you stay in credit and don’t run up fees and charges

#### Choosing the right type of account
For both your main account and bills accounts, look for a current or fee-free basic bank account that allows you to set up Direct Debits and standing orders.

Check you don’t have to pay a minimum amount into the account each month.

#### Using a comparison website to find a bank account
Comparison websites are a good starting point to find a bank account that’s right for you.

We recommend the following websites for comparing current accounts:

[Go Compare*](http://money.gocompare.com/currentaccounts)

[Moneyfacts](http://moneyfacts.co.uk/bank-accounts/best-bank-accounts)

[Money Saving Expert](http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/banking/compare-best-bank-accounts)

[Money Supermarket](http://www.moneysupermarket.com/current-accounts/search/results/?goal=CUR_INTEREST)

* Go Compare allows you to use the government-backed Midata tool to securely upload your past transactions. This will give you current account recommendations based on your personal spending.

#### Remember:
* Comparison websites won’t give you the same results. Make sure you use more than one site before you decide.
* Research the type of bank account you need before choosing one
* Find out more in our [guide to comparison sites.](/en/articles/price-comparison-sites-guide)

#### Using a jam jar account
Jam jar accounts are specially designed to let you put your money into different ‘jars’ in the same account.

Jam jar accounts work like this:

* when money comes into your account, you set aside an amount for bills
* these bills are then paid by Direct Debit or standing order
* you can put money that’s left onto a pre-paid card or take it out from a cashpoint machine

#### Pros
* You only have to manage one bank account.
* The account provider usually manages all your Direct Debits and standing orders for you.
* These accounts sometimes come with budgeting advice.

#### Cons
* You may be charged a fee of between £5 and £15 a month plus charges for taking money out.
* You will need to work out if this is worth paying compared to a bank account with no charges that you manage yourself

#### Social housing tenants and jam jar accounts
Social housing landlords and councils have been working with credit unions to offer tenants jam jar accounts with lower fees.

Some may even pay the fees for you to help you open an account.

#### Opening a jam jar account
Check if your local credit union offers a jam jar account.

Find your local credit union:

In England, Wales or Scotland – the [Association of British Credit Unions website.](http://www.findyourcreditunion.co.uk/home)

In Northern Ireland – [Irish Federation of Credit Unions](http://www.creditunion.ie/) or [Ulster Federation of Credit Unions.](http://www.ufcu.co.uk/)

If you rent from a social landlord, ask if they offer a jam jar account with your local credit union.

#### Using real jam jars
You can use real containers like jam jars or envelopes to help you manage your money.

If you’re budgeting using real containers:

* mark a jar for each of your spending needs
* take cash from the jar to pay each bill as it comes in
* take cash out before you go shopping

Try to stick to a rule of ‘when it’s gone, it’s gone’.

For example, if your petrol jar is empty don’t dip into your electricity jar instead.

If you have any cash left in the jars at the end month, try to get into the habit of putting it towards an [emergency savings fund.](/en/articles/emergency-savings-how-much-is-enough)

#### Pros
* Having cash in containers reminds you how much you’re spending during the month – so may help you spend less.

#### Cons
* Paying for everything in cash isn’t always the best way
* You’ll miss out on the perks of paying bills by Direct Debit, like cheaper tariffs and automatic bill payment
* You’ll need to be extra careful about security if you keep a lot of cash in the house
