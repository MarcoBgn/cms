Feature: Resize blog thumbnail image
  As a user with limited bandwidth,
  In order to save time when looking for advice on personal finance.
  I want the web pages to load faster whilst browsing.

  Scenario:
  Given that I am a CMS admin
  When I upload a file
  Then I should see the original url of the file
